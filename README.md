# InterIm

InterIm is an [Immediate mode GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI) library in pure Scala.

It provides methods to build an interface and return a sequence of simple render operations (render rectangles and render text).

The library does not perform any rendering. The resulting output must be interpreted by a rendering backend.
While this might sound like a limitation, it actually allows for an easy integration with other libraries.

To know more about the library and how to get started check the [examples](https://github.com/JD557/interim/tree/master/examples).
