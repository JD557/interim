<h1>InterIm</h1>

<h2>What is InterIm?</h2>
<p>
  IterIm is a minimal Scala library for immediate mode GUIs.
</p>

<p>
  The library itself doesn't perform any rendering or IO by itself, but it provides a simple interface so that it can be
  easilly integrated on custom backends: The backend sends InterIm the current input and gets back a list of colored
  rectangles and text regions to render.
</p>

<p>
  The lack of a backend also ensures that the library can be used in JVM, Scala.js and Scala Native applications.
</p>

<h2>Development status</h2>
<p>
  InterIm is still in a <strong>0.x version</strong>. Quoting the semver specification:
  <blockquote>
    Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
  </blockquote>

  As such, while it's OK to use InterIm for small demos, it's not recommended to use it for commercial projects.
